# Title: PacMen Factory Exercise

_Created by Maegan Stayrook_

Description:
A fun exercise through MIT MERN Full Stack course to generate a seemingly endless amount of PacMen at the touch of a button. Play now!

How to Run:
1. Click "Let's make some PacMen!" button to generate PacMen.
2. Click "Animate PacMen!" button to make them move.
3. Click "Start over!" to refresh the screen.
4. Done with the game? Check out Maegan's portfolio by clicking on "Check out my portfolio!"

Roadmap:
- Bring the buttons to the "front" so the PacMen do not float over them, blocking the buttons.
- Have them interact with one another and bounce off one another.
- Have more fun text.
- Maybe add ghosts! If the ghosts hit a PacMan, it's a 50/50 chance on which one disappears.
